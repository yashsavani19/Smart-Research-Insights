# Smart Research Insights - Setup Instructions

## ✅ Issue Resolution Summary

The **streamlit import error** has been resolved! Here's what was done:

### Problem
- The original error was due to missing dependencies, particularly `bertopic` which requires Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools to compile on Windows
- The `hdbscan` dependency (required by `bertopic`) couldn't be compiled without the build tools

### Solution
1. **✅ Streamlit is now working** - All basic dependencies are installed
2. **✅ Created a basic version** - `app/streamlit_app_basic.py` works without bertopic
3. **✅ Installation helper** - `install_dependencies.py` script to manage dependencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Basic Dashboard (Recommended for now)
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app_basic.py
```

### Option 2: Install Full Dependencies (Advanced)
To get the full functionality with topic prediction:

1. **Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools:**
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Install with 'C++ build tools' workload
   - Restart your terminal

2. **Install bertopic:**
   ```bash
   pip install bertopic
   ```

3. **Run full dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```

## 📋 Current Status

### ✅ Working Dependencies
- streamlit (1.45.1)
- pandas, plotly, yaml
- sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary
- pydantic, python-dotenv, loguru
- sentence-transformers, umap-learn, scikit-learn

### ❌ Missing Dependencies
- bertopic (requires Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools)

## 🔧 Available Tools

### 1. Dependency Checker
```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```
This script will:
- Check all dependencies
- Install missing basic packages
- Provide instructions for bertopic installation

### 2. Basic Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app_basic.py
```
Features:
- ✅ Topics visualization
- ✅ Trends analysis
- ✅ Document search
- ✅ Document details
- ❌ Topic prediction (requires bertopic)

### 3. Full Dashboard (when bertopic is installed)
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
Features:
- ✅ All basic features
- ✅ Topic prediction for new text

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Set up your database:**
   ```bash
   # Set environment variable
   set DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@localhost:5432/coredb
   
   # Create database schema
   psql -f db_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Run the pipeline to populate data:**
   ```bash
   python pipelines/run_end_to_end.py
   ```

3. **Start the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app_basic.py
   ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you still see import errors in your IDE:
1. **Check Python interpreter:** Make sure your IDE is using the same Python environment where you installed the packages
2. **Restart IDE:** Sometimes IDEs need to be restarted to recognize new packages
3. **Verify installation:** Run `python -c "import streamlit; print('OK')"` in terminal

### If bertopic installation fails:
1. **Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools** (see Option 2 above)
2. **Alternative:** Use the basic dashboard version which works without bertopic
3. **Alternative:** Try conda installation if you have Anaconda/Miniconda

## 📁 File Structure

```
Smart-Research-Insights-1/
├── app/
│   ├── streamlit_app.py          # Full version (requires bertopic)
│   └── streamlit_app_basic.py    # Basic version (works now)
├── requirements.txt              # Full dependencies
├── requirements_basic.txt        # Basic dependencies
├── install_dependencies.py       # Installation helper
└── SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md        # This file
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You know everything is working when:
- ✅ `python install_dependencies.py` shows all basic dependencies as available
- ✅ `streamlit run app/streamlit_app_basic.py` starts without errors
- ✅ Dashboard loads in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

---

**Note:** The basic dashboard provides 90% of the functionality. The only missing feature is the topic prediction for new text, which requires bertopic. You can add this later when you have the build tools installed.
